<p>An explanation of the rules can be found at
<a href="http://hanafubuki.org/rules.html">www.hanafubuki.org</a>. To play a card
drag it onto the card you wish to capture or an empty space (valid targets will
be highlighted). Current house rules:

<ul>
<li>If a player decides to koikoi the multiplier for both players doubles. This is the only way it changes.</li>
<li>Score is not doubled if you have over 7 points.</li>
<li>Flower viewing and Moon viewing are both active.</li>
<li>The sake cup only scores as junk (dregs), not animal.</li>
<li>Special draws don't score. They're silently re-drawn in the background.</li>
</ul>
Rule variants may be made available later.</p>

<p>The client has been tested in Firefox, Opera and Chromium (Chrome). It should work in any modern browser with
proper javascript support.</p>
